# mimsa

Mimsa is a small programming language.

It is inspired syntactically by `Elm` and `Haskell`.

It works by saving expressions into a database and referencing them by hashes like `Unison`.

It can be used through a `repl` or it's own web-based editor.

It compiles to readable Javascript.

It aims to become a specialised DSL for small backend services, much like `Elm` is for frontends, however currently it's just a fun way to play with functional programming without installing anything.
